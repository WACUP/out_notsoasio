# out_notsoasio
This is a modified release of the ASIO Output plug-in originally provided by Otachan. This version has been provided to allow for better integration with the Winamp v5.66x &amp; WACUP releases as well as some general clean-up &amp; SDK updates as the plug-in is originally from 2006.

It is provided as-is with all changes applied over the top of the existing source code (note: some files have been changed &/or removed compared to the original source code release). The Winamp 5.55 SDK as well as some of the newer Winamp 5.666 header files from <a target="_blank" href="https://getwacup.com/sdk/">here</a> are required to build this release. The ASIO SDK used to build this plug-in (v2.3.2) is also included within this repository.
